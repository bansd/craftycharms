I"¡<p>Hello Everyone,</p>

<p>I want to share some Diwali cards made using gorgeous crafty meraki stamps. I love their latest Diwali release and I would highly recommend you to check their new products. I had made these cards while back, but just didnâ€™t get to post them due to blog upgrades.</p>

<p>I stamped the stamps using antique linen distress ink and colored them using prismacolors. They took so long for coloring, but totally worth it!!!</p>

<p>I also embellished the cards using diamond cut stones I got from a store in India. I miss those days when buying embellishments would not burn a hole in your pocket.</p>

<p>Cheers,
Bansari</p>

I"s<p>As most of you know, I love interactive cards, and halloween is great theme to include as many interactive-ness in your cards. Today I’ll be sharing a cute ghost inside a painting card.</p>

<p>I have used ghostly greetings stamp set from MFT to stamp 3 Headstones and a ghost. I have used copic markers, mostly in shades of C, T, N, and W to color them.
For the base painting, I used distress oxide inks to get that chalky effect. I have used worn lipstick, seedless preserves and fossilized amber. I stamped them a plastic sheet, spiritzed it with water and them put my carstock on it. I did it multiple times to get more color on my paper.</p>

<p>For the ghost swinging mechansim in this card, I have used swing interactive dies from MFT, however, you can also build that mechanism by yourself too. I have then used rectangle frame dies from lawn fawn to put everything together. In retrospect, I think I should have used gold paper, just to get that vintage frame charm. I’ll save this for my next card. :)</p>

<p>And lastly, for the sentiment, I have used “You’re my favorite Creeper from MFT”.</p>

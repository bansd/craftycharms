I"˜	<p>Hey there! Can you believe it is September already, I seriously cannot. The things have been just crazy for everyone in this COVID-era, but the things are only getting crazier for parents, since schools are opening now. Dear Parents, hang in there, you got this!</p>

<p>I recently got my package from pretty pink posh, and and I had to use their products in this card. I have achieved the background by blending twisted citron, evergreen borough and scattered straw distress inks on jungle background stencils. I die-cut some leaves borders using leafy die, and colored them using copic markers. I stamped the monkeys in the stamp set using memento black ink and colored them using copic markers.</p>

<p>Alright, now time for interactive mechanism, I die cut all elements from interactive swing die from MFT from some scrap papers. I try to reuse my scrap stash as much as possible. I put double foam tape on the top tree cardstock which I colored using different distress inks of green shade. I hid the swinging bar by putting leafy border on it, so it may seem that monkey is hanging through the branch from the tree. Finally, I embossed ‚Äúhang in there‚Äù sentiment from the same stampset using black embossing powder.</p>

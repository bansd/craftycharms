I"¥<p>Hello All! I am back again with a bang, I finally have video ready for Interactive Pull tab card inspired from one of my favorite Up movie. I am so sorry that I had been not able to upload new posts for a while, but I had been swamped with lot of stuff at work. I hope you guys find the video useful!
The camera goes crazy with auto focus, so I had to cut my all the coloring part with copics. But hopefully, you can enjoy rest of the video, and especially the part where I was able to hide the pull tab.</p>

<p>I stamped balloon bundle stampset from MFT using Memento black ink pad. I love to use this ink-pad especially when I am coloring with copics. I also stamped and colored house, fence, trees, car, shipping boxes from happy village set from lawn fawn. I colored all the images using my copic markers.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll try my best to explain how I put together pull tab mechanism but I would highly recommend to watch the video for simplicity sake. So, I used one horizontal strip of paper and fold it along the breadth of top card, and glued balloons on top of it. I then flipped the card to add a strip perpendicular to this horizontal strip, so, it is parallel to the top card, but it is behind the top card. And youâ€™ll use this vertical strip to pull the balloons.</p>

<p>Please note, I had already attached balloons to the house before I attached balloons to the horizontal strip, so house will also move together, when I pull the vertical pull tab strip. I had built background using MFT cloud stencil and die-cut hill using hill dies from mama elephant, and colored it using twisted citron distress ink. Once everything was put in place I attached the top card on the bottom base card using foam tape. And, then I glued rest of the images(trees, fence, car, boxes) I had stamped on the top card. For the sentiment, I used one BB Adorable Elephants which is from MFT stamps, however I think I use different one in video, and that is from adorable Adventures stamp set. I used white embossing powder from Wow to emboss the sentiment on a black cardstock.</p>

<p>And thatâ€™s all! Hope you enjoyed reading this, and I just canâ€™t wait to see what your create!</p>

<p>Happy Friday Yaâ€™ll!</p>

<p>Cheers,
Bansari</p>

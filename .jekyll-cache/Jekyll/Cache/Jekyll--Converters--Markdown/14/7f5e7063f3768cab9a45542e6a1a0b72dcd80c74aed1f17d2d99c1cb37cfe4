I"Š<p>So, I decided it was time to start a blog to share my love for arts and crafts. With motivation and support from my husband and family, I am super excited to start this blog. No pressure at all, will just see how it goes. This is my first post, and as they say, firsts are always special, so I had to cherish this special moment.</p>

<p>Many of you might not know, but I am a software engineer by the day, and a crafter by the night. Whenever a newbie starts to code or even when a seasoned engineer decides to learn a new language â€” the first thing they do is get the computer to say â€œHello, World!â€. Nearly everyone swears by this tradition, and by all means, I wish to honor that by creating my very first â€œhello world!â€ card for this blog.</p>

<p>Truth to be told, since this was my first post, I had built an inate pressure to make a perfect â€œhelloâ€ card. There were tons of ideas popping in my mind, and I was really having a hard time deciding a theme or layout for the card. Lol, happens to many of us, all the time, pressure to be â€œperfectâ€. So, to break this, I just decided to go with the flow, I took my brush, colors, and started painting, and I came up with this card, simple, not-so-perfect but a perfect hello card.</p>

<p>I have used <a href="!https://www.amazon.com/Coliro-M600-Watercolor-Metallic-6-Color/dp/B01D081YK8">mica gold &amp; silver metallic watercolors set</a> for painting the stripes on the card. You can try this with any other color palette.</p>

<p>Since, I wanted to give loose brush texture on the sides, I did not mask a tape on the side. So, I have beautiful texture on the sides instead of smooth straight lines</p>

<p>I finally die-cut â€œhelloâ€ word, you can use any word combination here. You can see, I glued white color â€œhelloâ€ word on the black color, to give a 3d-shadow effect. And finally embellished the card by adding black Nuvo dots.</p>

<p>This card is such quick, simple, and so easy, you can switch the color combinations and words and create endless possibilities. I hope you like it, and I canâ€™t wait to see your creation! Thank you for stopping by and lots of love!</p>

<p>Cheers,
Bansari</p>

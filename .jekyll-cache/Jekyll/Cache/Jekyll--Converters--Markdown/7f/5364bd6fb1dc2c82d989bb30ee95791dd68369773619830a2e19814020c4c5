I"Y<p>It is very hard to get rid of paper scraps piling exponentially after each project. I had so much fun to use these scrap paper creatively.</p>

<p>First of all, I used Tim Holtz trimmer to trim all the scrap papers to about quarter inch. Now, use a double sided adhesive sheet, it’s okay if you don’t have that, you can also use your tape runner and run it multiple times on your base paper.</p>

<p>Now, take different strips at a time, and paste it on top of your adhesive sheet. I usually start from the middle and go towards end. 
Once, the sheet is fully covered by strips, cut off excess long strips, so you can reuse them.</p>

<p>I have then used stitched rectangle die to cut 4.25” X 5.5” paper from your sticky adhesive sheet. I have then used alphabet dies from scrapbook.com to die-cut happy fall from card stock. Now, use masking tape, so you can remove die-cut letters and paste it on other card. 
Now peel off other side of your sheet and stick on base cardstock. And that’s all!</p>

<p>Happy Fall Ya’ll!</p>

<p>Cheers,
Bansari</p>

I"Õ	<p>In todayâ€™s post, Iâ€™ll be sharing a slimline card that I have made using AveryElle peek a boo pets stamp set. I actually loved this theme so much so that I almost got their entire peek-a-boo set.</p>

<p>I had cut a solar white neenah cardstock into 7â€ x 9â€ and folded it into half, so itâ€™s 3.5â€ x 9â€. Then, Iâ€™ve used wave stitched die and cut papers to get mountains and used distress inks to give green meadow effect.</p>

<p>I also used a cloud stencil that I cut myself using silhouette cameo machine to and used tumbled glass distress ink to color the cloud silhouette. I also used dotted wavy border die by Avery Elle to cut out the mountains.</p>

<p>For the farm animal critters, I have used X-Press IT copic blending paper to stamp and used copic colors to color them. This was my first time using copic blending papers, and man, so worth the money!!! I was so impressed by the blending result I was able to achieve. I will be still researching for more papers for copic but till then will be using Xpress-It pad.</p>

<p>And then I just die-cut all my images and put together on the stamp. Now, looking back I wish I could have sprayed water mist on the meadow, just to get that â€œmagicalâ€ distress ink texture. And thatâ€™s all folks!</p>

<p>I hope you are having amazing long weekend so far! Also, be sure to catch those amazing crafty deals!</p>

I"a	<p>Hello Everyone,</p>

<p>I am very much excited to bring Diwali Special Blog Post. TLDR, watch my youtube video below to check how I spin up these Diwali cards.
Diwali is one of most important Hindu festivals, and it signifies festival of lights. Diwali to me, is family, fun, yummy food and sweets, lamps, lights, fireworks, bright colors and laughter. I will try to capture this essence of Diwali in my cards today.</p>

<p>I will be using two different stenciling techniques to make the card. First card is made by blending various distress ink colors on top of stencil. Second card is made in a bit different way than the first. I have colored the background using wilted violet and faded jeans distress ink colors, I then apply same colors on top of a stencil to saturate the colors, and this will create stunning result, once you lift off the stencil.</p>

<p>I then use glitter foam sheet to die-cut gorgeous “Happy Diwali” sentiment from Crafty Meraki. I simply love their entire Diwali collection, so be sure you check that out. Be sure to check out my video for dealing with delicate die-cut sentiment. I struggle so much for first card, but I found a way to do it easily for my second card. And then put everything together on top of neenah solar white cardstock. And that’s all folks!</p>

<p>Cheers,
Bansari</p>

I"0	<p>This is one of the most easiest and yummiest interactive card I’ve ever made. I love love ice-cream especially any flavors with chocolate in it. I tried to put some of my favorite flavors in this card, while I am on no-icecream diet.</p>

<p>I’ve used Hero Arts I scream you scream stamp set. This is one of the firsts stampset I bought when I had started stamping, and never letting it go. Alright, so, I stamped as many as ice cream scoops in some of my favorite flavors using Altenew Ink Pads. Instead of deciding, which one to use, I used all of them in this card. I then fussy cut all my stamped images. This card is a simple pull mechanism where I have glued ice-cream scoops on the top of the pull-tab mechanism.</p>

<p>I have used solar white Neenah Cardstock as my base, and baby pink cardstock as my top layer. I self-embossed upper pink card by scoring lines diagonally using my scoring board on equal intervals, I think I have used half inch interval to score lines. I put foam tapes on the back of pink card, so that will give some more room for pull tab mechanism to move.</p>

<p>My sentiment stamp is from sweetest wishes by MFT, where I have stamped it on a white paper using Memento Black Ink Pad. To cover up my mistakes, and make card look pretty, I have then used Nuvo Drops as embellishments on top of the card.</p>

Hello Everyone,

I am back again today with a new interactive card for valentine inspiration that I spinned up using Double Die Set from TLC designs. 

I am using double-die set from TLC Designs. I have used this interactive die in my previous projects and it is one of my favorites. I used white pattered paper to cut out all the die-cuts from the Set. Then, I used brad to attach the pieces together. The card mechanism looks so complicated, but it is very impressive that die-cut pieces are so easy to put together.

Next, I used copic markers to color the dragon from Happy the Dragon stamp set. I tried to color the dragon with different shades of red and pink. I got the felt heart cut-outs from Michaels last year and decided to use them, so it feels like Happy holds the heart when I move the mechanism.

I then die cut letters, 'H', 'E', 'A', 'R' and 'T' from lawn fawn alphabet die set. And I also glue printed sentiment(I printed it in my printer). Then I used foam cut-circles to attach dragon and hearts. This will give them some dimension, and more space to move around freely.

And that's it for today, folks. I will be back next week with some more cool and fun cards. 

Cheers,
Bansari

Hi there,

I am back today with a space-birthday theme interactive card. This is my card for innovation category - mft superstar 2020. I have created a double slider card where rocket takes off to space and a surprise is waiting. To add some more twist, I decided to add rocket stand that detaches from rocket  as it takes off to space.

    <div class="card-columns">
        <img src="/img/lazyload-ph.png" data-src="/img/2020-09-20-SpaceInteractiveCard/1a.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block lazyload" alt="sanfran" />
        <img src="/img/lazyload-ph.png" data-src="/img/2020-09-20-SpaceInteractiveCard/1b.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block lazyload" alt="sanfran" />

    </div>

This will be a long post, so I’ll get to nitty gritty details right away. So, for the exterior of the card, I have created a double slider card. For the top panel, I wanted to create space background. To achieve that effect, I used distress oxide inks and sprayed water mist + opaque white copic color.

I used white gelly rolly pen to create shining stars, and I also used wow embossing powder metallic gold powder to emboss stars stamped from ——-.
For the lower panel, I used cloud stencils to create some clouds, initially when rocket takes off, it will show like the smoke is from rocket, and later it will have a suprise sentiment hidden that will display when you pull the slider card.

<div class="col-12">
    <div class="card-columns">
        <img src="/img/lazyload-ph.png" data-src="/img/2020-09-20-SpaceInteractiveCard/1d.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block lazyload" alt="sanfran" />
        <img src="/img/lazyload-ph.png" data-src="/img/2020-09-20-SpaceInteractiveCard/1e.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block lazyload" alt="sanfran" />
    </div>
</div>

Now, for the top middle pannel, I have cut out a slot using ____. This is so that rocket can take off. Now, I added another slider card on top of existing slider card, so rocket can launch off automatically when you pull the older slider card panels. 

I cut out some stripes from black card stock to create a rocket-stand. Then I cut out arms from thicker card stock and attached one end to base of second slider card, and other one to top end of stand. This mechanism will make rocket gates move. 

Then I used double foam to attach rocket ship to the base of second double slider panel. 

I heat embossed two sentiments from —- and —— stamp set using opaque white embossing powder. And that’s front of the card.

Now, for the inside of the card, I created space background using same technique as mentioned above. I used black memento ink to stamp from  —— stampset. I used copic color markers to color them. I then cut out stripes from left over paper from space background and used them to create 3d pop out panels. I then glued my stamp images on top of these panels. And that’s it!

In today's post, I'll be sharing a slimline card that I have made using AveryElle peek a boo pets stamp set. I actually loved this theme so much so that I almost got their entire peek-a-boo set.

I had cut a solar white neenah cardstock into 7" x 9" and folded it into half, so it's 3.5" x 9". Then, I've used wave stitched die and cut papers to get mountains and used distress inks to give green meadow effect.

I also used a cloud stencil that I cut myself using silhouette cameo machine to and used tumbled glass distress ink to color the cloud silhouette. I also used dotted wavy border die by Avery Elle to cut out the mountains.

For the farm animal critters, I have used X-Press IT copic blending paper to stamp and used copic colors to color them. This was my first time using copic blending papers, and man, so worth the money!!! I was so impressed by the blending result I was able to achieve. I will be still researching for more papers for copic but till then will be using Xpress-It pad.

And then I just die-cut all my images and put together on the stamp. Now, looking back I wish I could have sprayed water mist on the meadow, just to get that "magical" distress ink texture. And that's all folks!

I hope you are having amazing long weekend so far! Also, be sure to catch those amazing crafty deals!

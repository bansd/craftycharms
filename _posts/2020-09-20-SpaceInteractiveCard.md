Hi there,

I am back today with a space-birthday theme interactive card. This is my card for innovation category - MFT Superstar 2020. I have created a double slider card(with a twist ;)) where rocket takes off to the space and a surprise is awaiting. To make it little more challenging, I decided to add rocket stand that detaches from rocket as it takes off to space. This mechanism took me forever, but I am glad I was able to put everything together just in time.

I have mostly used Best Friends in the Universe and Blast-off Dienamics by MFT for this card, but also have mixed sentiments or critters from other stamp set, which I will mention as we progress.

This will be a long post, so I’ll get to nitty gritty details right away. For the exterior of the card, I have created a double slider card. For the top panel, I wanted to create space background, because that's where the space rocket will take off to. To achieve that effect, I used distress oxide inks and sprayed water mist + opaque white copic color.

Then, I used white gelly rolly pen to create shining stars, and I also used wow embossing powder metallic gold powder to emboss stars stamped from Best Friends in the Universe stamp set from MFT.

For the lower panel, I used cloud stencils to create some clouds, initially when rocket takes off, it will show like the smoke is from the rocket, and later it will have a suprise sentiment hidden that will display when you pull the slider card to it's maximum.

        <img src="/img/lazyload-ph.png" data-src="/img/2020-09-20-SpaceInteractiveCard/1d.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block lazyload" alt="sanfran" />

    </div>

Now, for the top middle pannel, I have cut out a slot using Swing Dienamics Die-Set. This is so that rocket can take off. And then, I added another slider card on top of existing slider card, so rocket can launch off automatically when you pull the older slider card panels. Remember, the twist I was talking about. I'll call it a triple slider card, although looking back, I think there are some possibilities to simplify the mechanism, however, I am glad I ended up creating/learning triple slider card.

Now, for the rocket stand, I cut out some stripes from black card stock. Then, I cut out arms from thicker card stock and attached one end to base of second slider card, and other one to top end of stand. This mechanism will make rocket gates move, when the slider card panel move up. I then used double foam tape to attach rocket ship to the base of second double slider panel. 

Time for sentiments, I heat embossed two sentiments from Birthday-Yay and Best Friends in the Universe stamp set using opaque white embossing powder on a black color cardstock. And that’s it for the front of the card.

Now, for the inside of the card, I created space background using same technique as mentioned above. I used black memento ink to stamp from Best Friends in the Universe stampset. Then, I used copic color markers to color them. I also cut out stripes from left over paper from space background and used them to create 3d pop out panels. I then glued my stamp images on top of these panels. 

And that’s all folks, you get a 3D space card with lot of surprises!

Hello Everyone,

Isn't interactive card fun? Btw, I have some very exciting news to share with you all, which I'll do next week, so wait for it! I have made a video to walk you through my card making process. So, hope you enjoy watching it!

The bumping into each other mechanism is actually double slider mechanism beneath the hood. I'll be using MFT Double Slider Loop Die, but you can easily create slider slots using craft blade. I am using Avery Elle Peek a boo Fair and Coaster Stamp sets for the card today. I stamped it using Memento Black Ink and colored using various Copic markers. 

I then cut out double slider loop on a white paper strip, and used a strip from plastic sandwich bag(you can get this easily from any grocery store) to create sliding loop. I used stapler to secure the ends together. Cut out strips and place first one on top left, and second one on bottom right. Use another paper strip that will make the mechanism pull. 

I am using orange strip to cover the sliding mechanism. Use "bumping by to say hi" sentiment from same stamp set and stamp it on top of this orange strip. I have used hero arts gometric stencils to color the background card using fossilized amber distress ink.

Now, glue the bumper cars on each end, and put a foam tape where they meet each other. This will be the stopping point of slider mechanism. I have also added a speech bubble from Summer Pals stamp set to the background. And that's all folks!

Cheers,
Bansari

#### Tips
- Stamp the sentiment on the paper before gluing it to the main card.
- If your stapler is big like mine, you may have hard time putting these two ends together, in that case, just use a foam tape to secure the ends temporarily.

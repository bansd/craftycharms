So, I decided it was time to start a blog to share my love for arts and crafts. With motivation and support from my husband and family, I am super excited to start this blog. No pressure at all, will just see how it goes. This is my first post, and as they say, firsts are always special, so I had to cherish this special moment.

Many of you might not know, but I am a software engineer by the day, and a crafter by the night. Whenever a newbie starts to code or even when a seasoned engineer decides to learn a new language — the first thing they do is get the computer to say “Hello, World!”. Nearly everyone swears by this tradition, and by all means, I wish to honor that by creating my very first "hello world!" card for this blog.

Truth to be told, since this was my first post, I had built an inate pressure to make a perfect "hello" card. There were tons of ideas popping in my mind, and I was really having a hard time deciding a theme or layout for the card. Lol, happens to many of us, all the time, pressure to be "perfect". So, to break this, I just decided to go with the flow, I took my brush, colors, and started painting, and I came up with this card, simple, not-so-perfect but a perfect hello card.

I have used [mica gold & silver metallic watercolors set](!https://www.amazon.com/Coliro-M600-Watercolor-Metallic-6-Color/dp/B01D081YK8) for painting the stripes on the card. You can try this with any other color palette. 

Since, I wanted to give loose brush texture on the sides, I did not mask a tape on the side. So, I have beautiful texture on the sides instead of smooth straight lines

I finally die-cut "hello" word, you can use any word combination here. You can see, I glued white color "hello" word on the black color, to give a 3d-shadow effect. And finally embellished the card by adding black Nuvo dots.

This card is such quick, simple, and so easy, you can switch the color combinations and words and create endless possibilities. I hope you like it, and I can't wait to see your creation! Thank you for stopping by and lots of love!

Cheers,
Bansari

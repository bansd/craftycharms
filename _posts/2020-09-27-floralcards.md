I love to use watercolors with any project. Absolutely love how much satisfying the whole process it. I wish I could devote more time everyday to watercolor. 

I have used peony bouquet builder stamp set from Waffle Flower Craft. I have used Alpine Rose and Persimmon colors from Dr. Ph. Martin's Bombay India Ink for the beautiful roses. I have used Juniper Green and Grass Green from the same set for the leaves. I cut out the flowers and leaves using matching die, and arranged on a patterned white cardstock. I then splattered some white and black paint on the card to add some texture to the card. 

I have used sentiment from Altenew's Beautiful Day stampset. I stamped it using Memento Black Ink. To add the dew drops on the card, I have used Glossy Accents. I really love to use this product, and try to use it in my projects as much as possible.

That's all folks! I hope you enjoyed reading this post. See you soon!

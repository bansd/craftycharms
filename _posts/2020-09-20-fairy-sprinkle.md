excerpt:
  A Watercolor card using Fairy Stamps from MFT

This is my another take on CAS card for MFT Superstar Challenge. I intended to achieve dreamy fairy card. I used Mission Water Color and Zig markers to color the fairy from Flower Fairies stampset. I simply love the cuteness in this stamp set. 

And that's all for today! Enjoy rest of your weekend! 

Cheers,
Bansari

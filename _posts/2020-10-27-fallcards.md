It is very hard to get rid of paper scraps piling exponentially after each project. I had so much fun to use these scrap paper creatively.

First of all, I used Tim Holtz trimmer to trim all the scrap papers to about quarter inch. Now, use a double sided adhesive sheet, it's okay if you don't have that, you can also use your tape runner and run it multiple times on your base paper. 

Now, take different strips at a time, and paste it on top of your adhesive sheet. I usually start from the middle and go towards end. 
Once, the sheet is fully covered by strips, cut off excess long strips, so you can reuse them. 

I have then used stitched rectangle die to cut 4.25" X 5.5" paper from your sticky adhesive sheet. I have then used alphabet dies from scrapbook.com to die-cut happy fall from card stock. Now, use masking tape, so you can remove die-cut letters and paste it on other card. 
Now peel off other side of your sheet and stick on base cardstock. And that's all!

Happy Fall Ya'll!

Cheers,
Bansari

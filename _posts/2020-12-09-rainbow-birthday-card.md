Hello Everyone,

I am back again today with a new Card I spinned up using TLC designs. It was getting pretty gloomy here, with rain and everything, but no hopes of snow. Also, my buddy's birthday is coming up soon, so I think this was perfect time to bring out the rainbow sunshine.

For my card today, I decided to use this gorgeous celebrate dies. I used the bigger and smaller die and cut out a piece from the cardstock. I then used various distress oxide inks to give rainbow color blending on the base card and the smaller die-cut card. The card with cupcakes die-cut will be left white. But, I think a glitter or a stenciling will also look good. I then glued cupcake-bordered card to the bottom base card, so you can have the colorful rainbow color peeking thru the cupcake. And the another rainbow panel goes on top on cupcake bordered card. 

I then die-cut oval celebrate frame and the inner border die + cake die on a gold color cardstock. I also cut oval celebrate frame on solar white cardstock. I used some liquid glue to adhere gold frame on the white die-cut oval paper, just so, it can have some dimension. I also adhered gold frame cake on the oval paper. I used foam tape to adhere this oval frame on the rainbow cardstock.

And that's it for today, folks. I will be back next week with some more cool and fun cards. 

Cheers,
Bansari

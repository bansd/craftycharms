Hello Everyone,

I want to share some Diwali cards made using gorgeous crafty meraki stamps. I love their latest Diwali release and I would highly recommend you to check their new products. I had made these cards while back, but just didn't get to post them due to blog upgrades. 

I stamped the stamps using antique linen distress ink and colored them using prismacolors. They took so long for coloring, but totally worth it!!!

I also embellished the cards using diamond cut stones I got from a store in India. I miss those days when buying embellishments would not burn a hole in your pocket. 

Cheers,
Bansari

  An Interactive Card Affair with Crafty Meraki Stamps

Hello Everyone,

I seriously cannot get over Diwali stamps by Crafty Meraki. Here's is another interactive Diwali card made using Crafty Meraki stamps and Lawn Fawn Magic Card Interactive Die Set.

I first colored the Diya stamp using prisma colors and used interactive dies from Lawn Fawn. It was very straightforward from there. 

I might do one card without this interactive die in the future and probably create a tutorial video. Till then, bye folks! I am off to Diwali cleaning and preparation!

Cheers,
Bansari

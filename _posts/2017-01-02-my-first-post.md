So, I decided it was time to start a blog to share my love for arts and crafts. With motivation and support from my husband and family, I am super excited to start this blog where I can share my crafty adventures. No pressure at all, will just see how it goes. As they say, firsts are always special, and to commemorate this day, I had to create a "hello world" card.

This is a simple hello card that I have created using

<img src="/img/lazyload-ph.png" data-src="/img/sanfran.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block lazyload" alt="sanfran" />

I hope you like it!

Hello All! I am back again with a bang, I finally have video ready for Interactive Pull tab card inspired from one of my favorite Up movie. I am so sorry that I had been not able to upload new posts for a while, but I had been swamped with lot of stuff at work. I hope you guys find the video useful!
The camera goes crazy with auto focus, so I had to cut my all the coloring part with copics. But hopefully, you can enjoy rest of the video, and especially the part where I was able to hide the pull tab.

I stamped balloon bundle stampset from MFT using Memento black ink pad. I love to use this ink-pad especially when I am coloring with copics. I also stamped and colored house, fence, trees, car, shipping boxes from happy village set from lawn fawn. I colored all the images using my copic markers.

I'll try my best to explain how I put together pull tab mechanism but I would highly recommend to watch the video for simplicity sake. So, I used one horizontal strip of paper and fold it along the breadth of top card, and glued balloons on top of it. I then flipped the card to add a strip perpendicular to this horizontal strip, so, it is parallel to the top card, but it is behind the top card. And you'll use this vertical strip to pull the balloons. 

Please note, I had already attached balloons to the house before I attached balloons to the horizontal strip, so house will also move together, when I pull the vertical pull tab strip. I had built background using MFT cloud stencil and die-cut hill using hill dies from mama elephant, and colored it using twisted citron distress ink. Once everything was put in place I attached the top card on the bottom base card using foam tape. And, then I glued rest of the images(trees, fence, car, boxes) I had stamped on the top card. For the sentiment, I used one BB Adorable Elephants which is from MFT stamps, however I think I use different one in video, and that is from adorable Adventures stamp set. I used white embossing powder from Wow to emboss the sentiment on a black cardstock.

And that's all! Hope you enjoyed reading this, and I just can't wait to see what your create!

Happy Friday Ya'll!

Cheers,
Bansari

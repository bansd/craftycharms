This is one of the most easiest and yummiest interactive card I've ever made. I love love ice-cream especially any flavors with chocolate in it. I tried to put some of my favorite flavors in this card, while I am on no-icecream diet.

I've used Hero Arts I scream you scream stamp set. This is one of the firsts stampset I bought when I had started stamping, and never letting it go. Alright, so, I stamped as many as ice cream scoops in some of my favorite flavors using Altenew Ink Pads. Instead of deciding, which one to use, I used all of them in this card. I then fussy cut all my stamped images. This card is a simple pull mechanism where I have glued ice-cream scoops on the top of the pull-tab mechanism.

I have used solar white Neenah Cardstock as my base, and baby pink cardstock as my top layer. I self-embossed upper pink card by scoring lines diagonally using my scoring board on equal intervals, I think I have used half inch interval to score lines. I put foam tapes on the back of pink card, so that will give some more room for pull tab mechanism to move. 

My sentiment stamp is from sweetest wishes by MFT, where I have stamped it on a white paper using Memento Black Ink Pad. To cover up my mistakes, and make card look pretty, I have then used Nuvo Drops as embellishments on top of the card.

I finally completed my copics set. YAY, I know, right! And I wanted to go full in with all coloring copics. I wanted to do line vs no-line coloring and I thought enjoy the ride stampset by StampingBella was just perfect.

For the first card, I picked the fall evening theme. Normally, I take so many sittings to finish a card, but I finished this card in just one sitting. I then tried to create summer theme for my second card. The sentiment is also included with main stamp set, and I just perfectly fitted with my cards.

So, I decided it was time to start a blog to share my love for arts and crafts. With motivation and support from my husband and family, I am super excited to start this blog where I can share my crafty adventures. No pressure at all, will just see how it goes. As they say, firsts are always special, and I had to cherish this special moment.

Many of you might not know, but I am a software engineer by the day, and a crafter by the night. Whenever a newbie starts to code or even when a seasoned engineer decides to learn a new language—the first thing they do is get the computer to say “Hello, World!”. Nearly everyone swears by this tradition, and by all means, I wish to honor that by creating my very first "hello world!" card for this blog.

Truth to be told, since this was my first post, I had built an inate pressure to make a perfect "hello" card. There were tons of ideas popping in my mind, and I was really having a hard time deciding a theme or layout for the card. Lol, happens to many of us, all the time, pressure to be "perfect". So, to break this, I just decided to go with the flow, I took my brush, colors, and started painting, and I came up with this card, simple, not-so-perfect but a perfect hello card.

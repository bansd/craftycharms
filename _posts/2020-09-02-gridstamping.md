Phew, a second post, Yay! Today, I'll be making three different cards using one of my all-time favorite technique. Grid Stamping is such a fun and easy technique, especially when you want to make lot of cards quickly. Another reason I adore this technique is because, I can finally use those beautiful tiny stamps from my stamp set.

I am using we are memory keepers precision press, but you can tool any stamping tool you own. I would recommend you to use a stamping tool, as it makes stamping process so much easier. Now, it's also fine if you don't have stamping tool, you can probably make some adjustments using ruler and stamping block.

So, for my first card, I have used [hero arts - everything smiles](!https://www.joann.com/hero-arts-stamp-cut-everything-smiles/15405616.html) stamp set. 
1. Put each stamp at equal distance on your stamping grid. I have put them at 1 inch marker, both horizontally and vertically. 
2. I have used black memento dye ink for all the cards to stamp on 4.5 by 5.5 watercolor paper.
3. I wanted my first card to look bright and peppy. I have used bright and flourescent tombow markers. You can use watercolors, crayons, marker. Just go wild!
4. For the "Hello" card, I have die-cut speech bubble and stamped "Hello" sentiment, while for birthday card, I have used [hero arts - glitter embossing powder].

For my second card, I have used cupcakes from two different stamp sets - altenew and simon says stamp(links below). I had monochrome color scheme in my mind for this card, however, I ended up coloring my favorite cupcake flavors. Wow, I am already craving for a sweet. However, I tried to create pastel-y kind of look for this card

And for third card I have used candy set from jillibean stamps. I had someone amazing person in my mind while making this card, so to match their personality, I have used vibrant and bright colors. I decided to use prisma-color pencils, and I have chosen rainbow colors for each line. 

#### Tips
- You can also create a patterned paper and then cut multiple card base.
- You don't have to follow a line like I did for my cards here, you can stamp them randomly, believe me that'll look amazing too
- You can create poly, duo, or mono color theme. Or even just color few randomly, it is upto your creativity and follow your heart.

Hello Everyone,

I am back again today with a new birthday cupcake card made using TLC Design products. 

I am using Cherry On Top Die from TLC Designs. I recently got foam sprinkles from Amazon, and I was dying to use it in my project. And what better way to use sprinkles than in cupcake, for which these cupcake dies seemed perfect. 

I have used patterned cardstock, and TLC has amazing collection of digi patterned papers. Alright, now back to card making, I die cut the top and bottom part of cupcake, and put strong glue on top part, and just sprinkled foam balls, ofc my desk was a mess after wards, so I would recommend to use coffee filter to control the damage. I then glued both parts to cupcake base card.


And that's it for today, folks. I will be back next week with some more cool and fun cards. 

Cheers,
Bansari

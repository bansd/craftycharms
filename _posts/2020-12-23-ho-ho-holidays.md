Hello Everyone,

I am back again today with a new interactive card I spinned up using Double Die Set from TLC designs. It's snowing here, and I already feel like holidays. Even though, this year is way way different than what I had imagined, I am really grateful for how it has turn out to be. I finished my graduation, got married just before covid lockdown, started selling cards on Etsy(Yay!), and more than anything, I am thankful that my family and friends are safe. Got so much than I could've asked for. 

Today, in this card, Santa-Dragon, comes bearing lots of gifts for all of us. I am using double-die set. I used white paper to cut out all the die-cuts from the Set. Then, I used brad to attach the pieces together. The card mechanism looks so complicated, but it is very impressive that die-cut pieces are so easy to put together.
Next, I used copic markers to color the dragon from Happy the Dragon stamp set. I tried to mix green and red them to make the dragon look more festive. I also colored the hat from the stamp set, and glued it on his head. 

Next I stamped gift, from one of my old stamp set. For, building the house, I have used lawn fawn dies. I cut out the roof using red color cardstock, and the chimney using brown color cardstock. I then used faded jeans, chipped sapphire, and wilton violet distress ink to create night sky, and used white gelly roll pen to create snowy-like christmas night. Since, I ran out of snow builder, I used white gelly roll pen to create snow on the roof. I actually like how it came out to be. 

I attached the roof to the base card using tape runner, but I used foam tape for the chimney, so that gift has enough space to move up and down, as mechanism rotates. And then I used foam cut-circles to attach dragon and gift. This will give them some dimension, and more space to move around freely

And that's it for today, folks. I will be back next week with some more cool and fun cards. 

Cheers,
Bansari

  An Interative Halloween Card using Pretty Posh Pink Stamp Set

Pretty sure this is my first halloween card. Today, I am using halloween critters from Pretty Pink Posh Halloween Friends Set. 

For the background, I created spooky green background with distress inks. I glued a scrap paper cut into circle in the middle of the cardstock for the moon, and then smudged distress ink. I also cut out trees using lawn fawn tree-flap background dies. I stamped all the critters using black memento ink pad, and then used copic markers to color them.

I then cut hill and grass for the background  using dies from mama elephant. After putting everything together, I glued them. The cute little ghosts are hiding behind the tree flap.

I die cut the card using stitched dies for slimline card. I had cut out scalloped slimline die using white cardstock as the middle card base. And then put everything on top of yellow card base.

And that's all! Simple and Easy Halloween Card! Stay tuned for more interactive halloween cards!

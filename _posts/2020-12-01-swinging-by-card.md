Hello Everyone,

I have big news to share with you all. I am officially a Design Team member for TLC Designs and today I'll be sharing my first post featuring TLC Design Stamps, yay!!!! I am very much grateful and honored to be part of this amazing design team and want to thank Tammy from bottom of my heart for giving me this opportunity. 

For my card today, I decided to use this beautiful dragon from  Dreamer stamp set. I just love the cute dragon illustration. I stamped the dragon using memento ink pad on solar white neenah card stock. Memento is my my go-to ink when I color with copic markers. I used various shared in BV to color the dragon, and various shades in Y20-28 to color the moon.

I decided to create background using rest of the designs from the stamp, and I have used Light Gray Ink to stamp, so that more focus or highlight is on the cute dragon. I then finished the card by heat embossing "swinging by to say hi" sentiment on black paper, and used white embobssing powder. 

And that's it. I can't wait to share other creations, I especially love their interactive dies, such unique concepts, I'll put all the links below, so be sure to check them out!

Cheers,
Bansari

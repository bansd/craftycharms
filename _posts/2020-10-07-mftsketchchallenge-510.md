Fall is nearing and this card reminds me of camping, music, marshmallows and all my favorite things I do in fall. I absolutely love all of Stacey Yacula's illustrations, and I have used one of my favorite stampset Happy Campers from MFT for this weekly sketch challenge #510.

<div class="col-4">
<img src="/img/lazyload-ph.png" data-src="/img/2020/10/07-mftsketchchallenge-510/1d.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block lazyload" alt="sanfran" />
</div>

I stamped all the images in the stamp using black memento ink. This is my favorite ink, and it goes well with copic as well as water. Highly recommend you all to try it, if you have not already. I used copic Xpress-It cardstock to stamp all the images using Hero Arts Misti stamping tool. I colored them all using copic markers. Note that I added some yellow hue on the critters because they are enjoying campfire. 

For the card base, I have used solar white neenah cardstock. I have used distress inks to create starry night background. I have used broken china, faded jeans, seedless preserves and black soot. I then splattered water drops, and sprayed white acrylic paint to create stars in the sky. I have also used white gel pen to add some additional stars.

        
I cut a grassy panel using grass dies from mama elephant I think, and used distress ink to add color to the grass. I have used twisted citron, evergreen bough and pine needles. And then I put everything together and glued them. For the sentiment I have black embossed on white vellum paper, however, I am out of stick sheets, and hence you see glue spots below it. I wish I could take that back, but it was too late.

And that's all, I hope you enjoyed reading this, and I just can't wait to see what you'll create. 

Cheers,
